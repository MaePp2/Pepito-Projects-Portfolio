# Pepito-Projects-Portfolio
 This repository contains all of my Software Development, Data Analysis, and Data Presentation Projects during my undergraduate years at Mapúa University.
## Projects that were not included:
### TFYO WEBSITE (BOOTSTRAP, VUE.JS, AND FIREBASE)
We developed a website to increase Tech for Filipino Youth Organization’s visibility. Tech for Filipino Youth Organization is a non-profit organization that aims to raise awareness of the imbalance of educational opportunities for impoverished Filipino youth by providing them with tools that will allow them to learn and study at home.

### WATERVAULT MOBILE APPLICATION PROTOTYPE USING FIGMA
Water Vault is a project prototype presented as a daily water consumption reminder and tracker. With the use of FIGMA in developing the Water Vault application, we encouraged everyone to try the application prototype and have it assist them in maintaining a healthy and hydrated lifestyle.

### WEBMASTERS GUILD MERCHANDISE SYSTEM
We proposed a solution that would help WebMasters Guild, an organization from Mapúa University - Makati, sell their merchandise with the convenience of technology. Rather than using Google Forms and Excel spreadsheets to monitor inventory and tally profit, the application would acquire the existing solutions’ key features to automate the organizational officers' responsibilities of taking orders, managing profit, or tallying income. The proposed application will also have a database to store the merchandise sales instead of a basic Excel spreadsheet on which values are manually inputted.
